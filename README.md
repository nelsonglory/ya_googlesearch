# ya_googlesearch
This extension offers the possibility to add a simple Google search element to your Typo3 page. The intention was to replace the build-in search engine because of its poor performance at huge Typo3-Sites. You can customize this extension by modifying/adding your own stylesheets and templates to fit your needs.
